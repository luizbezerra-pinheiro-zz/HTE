Heterogeneous Treatment Effect

The objective of this project is to estimate the Heterogeneous Treatment Effect of a drug (Tranaxemic Acid) on a sample, the data used is confidential so it cannot be shared.

The first part is the preprocessing -> Feature engineering, Feature renaming ... (code given by the professors)

We used 2 strategies to arrive to this estimation:
1) Estimate the Average Treatment Effect over a clustered Data (ATE.Rmd)
2) Estimate the Heterogenous Treatment Effect directly using Random Forests (hte.Rmd)
