Import the data

```{r}
setwd("~/Documents/Polytechnique/MAP573-Data_Analysis_and_Unsupervised_Learning/Project/HTE")
don <- read.csv("data/4_computed_dataset.csv", header = TRUE)
summary(don)
head(don)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
